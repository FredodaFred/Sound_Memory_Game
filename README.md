My game has the following features

* Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* User loses the game after an(3) incorrect guess(es)
* Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* More than 4 functional game buttons
* Playback speeds up on each turn
* Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn
